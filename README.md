# **Trello Recreation**

### Overview

_**Trello** is a web-based Kanban-style list-making application. My project here involves recreating Trello in React.JS._

<br>

### Extra To-Do
- _Moving API call into own component (help needed!)_
	- _Passing down ZIP Code & apikey Props and having that component update weatherData Object in App.Js state._
- _Add optional notes for each task_
- _Add optional check-list for each task_
- _If a task is clicked on, do a pop-up that display's that task's details and make it so you can edit it's notes and checklist, etc. So when you go back to the board, the changes are there._

### Wireframes

>Wireframes to display desktop, tablet and mobile views.

### MVP

_The **Trello clone** MVP will house one task board with basic funcationlity such as adding new tasks to the board and rearranging tasks. The api call will also be part of the MVP which will display widgets (only one for mvp) that can be selected when creating the board._

#### Goals

- _Materialistic design_
- _Add task functionality_
- _Three different progress states._
- _Easy to read/view at first look._
- _Intuitive functionality_

|   React Router   | _I'll be using react router to create a landing page that links to the board and back.._ |
|   React Axios    | _This will be used for the API call for the widgets.._ |
|   React Spring   | _(stretch) I'll be using this to make each task drag & drop._ |
